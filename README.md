# FreeRTOS Ported to Raspberry Pi 2B

This provides a very basic port of FreeRTOS to Raspberry pi 2B, now with video!

## Howto Build

Type make

Currently the makefile expect an arm-none-eabi- toolchain in the path. Either export the path to yours or
modify the TOOLCHAIN variable in dbuild.config.mk file.

You may also need to modify the library locations in the Makefile:

    kernel.elf: LDFLAGS += -L"/usr/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/4.9.3" -lgcc
    kernel.elf: LDFLAGS += -L"/usr/lib/arm-none-eabi/lib" -lc

Format your SD card as FAT32
Copy the bootcode.bin and start.elf from here https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot
Copy the config.txt from /boot_stuff onto the SD card to fix over/underscanning
Copy the kernel7.img generated by make

You should see the green LED turn on while the videotest happens, then the led will continuously blink.

Screensize is currently hardcoded to 1920x1080 in Demo/Drivers/video.c
